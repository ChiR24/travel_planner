## Screenshots

### How to Add Screenshots

1. Take screenshots of the app:
   - **Android**: Press Power + Volume Down buttons
   - **iOS**: Press Side/Top + Home/Volume Up buttons
   - **Web**: Use browser's screenshot tool or print screen
   
2. Save screenshots to the `docs/screenshots` directory
3. Use descriptive filenames (e.g., `home_screen_dark_mode.png`)
4. Compress images to reduce file size (aim for < 300KB per image)
5. Update this document to reference the new screenshots

### Including Screenshots in Documentation

Use the following markdown syntax to include screenshots in documentation:

```markdown
![Alt Text](docs/screenshots/screenshot_name.png)
```

For the README.md file, use relative paths:

```markdown
![Home Screen](docs/screenshots/home_screen.png)
```

## Theme Variations

The app supports both light and dark themes. When adding screenshots, consider including both variants if the visual difference is significant.

## Best Practices

1. **Consistency**: Use the same device/emulator for all screenshots
2. **Clean Data**: Use sample data that looks realistic but doesn't contain personal information
3. **Cropping**: Focus on the relevant part of the screen
4. **Resolution**: Use high-resolution images (but compressed for file size)
5. **Annotations**: Consider adding numbered annotations for complex screens

## Updating for New Releases

When the app UI changes with new releases:
1. Take new screenshots of the affected screens
2. Replace the old screenshots in the `docs/screenshots` directory
3. Update the descriptions in this document if necessary
