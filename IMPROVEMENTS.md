# Travel Planner Improvements

This document summarizes the key improvements made to the Travel Planner application.

## Architecture Improvements

### 1. Feature-First Directory Structure
We've reorganized the codebase to follow a feature-first architecture, which improves maintainability and scalability:

```
lib/
├── core/                  # Core utilities, widgets, and theme
│   ├── utils/             # Shared utilities
│   ├── widgets/           # Reusable widgets
│   └── theme/             # Theme configuration
├── features/              # Feature modules
│   ├── itinerary/         # Itinerary feature
│   │   ├── data/          # Data sources and repositories
│   │   ├── domain/        # Business logic and models
│   │   └── presentation/  # UI components
│   ├── trip_management/   # Trip management feature
│   │   ├── data/
│   │   ├── domain/
│   │   └── presentation/
│   └── preferences/       # User preferences feature
│       ├── data/
│       ├── domain/
│       └── presentation/
└── ...                    # Other app-level files
```

### 2. Centralized Error Handling
Implemented a robust error handling system with:
- Typed error categories for better error management
- User-friendly error messages
- Integration with Riverpod for state-based error handling
- Consistent error UI presentation

## UI/UX Enhancements

### 1. Adaptive Layouts
Improved the app's responsiveness across different device sizes and orientations.

### 2. Loading States
Added skeleton loading screens to improve perceived performance and user experience during data fetching.

### 3. Haptic Feedback
Integrated haptic feedback for a more tactile and responsive user interface, using Flutter's built-in haptic feedback capabilities.

## New Features

### 1. AI-Powered Itinerary Generator
Added a new feature that uses AI to generate personalized travel itineraries based on:
- Destination
- Travel dates
- User preferences (adventure, relaxation, culture, etc.)
- Budget constraints

The AI generator creates detailed day-by-day itineraries with activities, dining options, and points of interest.

### 2. Offline Maps
Implemented offline map functionality to allow users to:
- Download maps for offline use
- View their itinerary locations without an internet connection
- Navigate to points of interest while offline

### 3. Social Sharing
Added the ability to share itineraries with friends and family through:
- Text summaries of the trip
- Visual itinerary sharing with images
- Integration with system sharing capabilities

## Technical Improvements

### 1. Dependency Updates
- Removed problematic dependencies like `flutter_haptic` in favor of Flutter's built-in haptic feedback
- Added `mapbox_gl` for improved map functionality
- Updated outdated packages to their latest versions

### 2. Model Refinements
Enhanced the data models to better represent the domain:
- Improved `Activity` model with location data
- Enhanced `Day` model for better organization of activities
- Refined `Itinerary` model for more comprehensive trip planning

## Next Steps

1. Continue migrating existing code to the new architecture
2. Add comprehensive tests for new components
3. Implement remaining UI components using the new adaptive layout system
4. Further enhance offline capabilities
