# Travel Planner Development Guide

This document provides technical details about the Travel Planner app architecture, design patterns, and development workflows.

## Architecture Overview

The Travel Planner app follows a feature-first architecture with Provider for state management. The codebase is organized as follows:

```
lib/
├── config/          # Configuration files, constants
├── core/            # Core utilities and base classes
├── features/        # Feature modules (trips, weather, maps, etc.)
├── models/          # Data models
├── platform/        # Platform-specific implementations
├── providers/       # State management providers
├── services/        # API services and repositories
├── theme/           # Theme data and styling
├── ui/              # Shared UI components
├── widgets/         # Reusable widgets
├── app.dart         # App entry point
└── main.dart        # Main application bootstrap
```

## Design Patterns

### Provider Pattern
We use the Provider package for state management across the app. This helps in:
- Separating business logic from UI
- Efficient rebuilds of only affected widgets
- Easier testing through dependency injection

### Repository Pattern
API services follow the repository pattern:
- Service classes for raw API calls
- Repository classes to transform data and handle caching
- Models for data representation

### Platform Channel Pattern
For platform-specific code, we use method channels:
- Platform interfaces defined in Dart
- Implementations for Android/iOS through method channels
- Web implementations using JS interop

## Key Components

### Trip Management
- `TripProvider` manages the state of trips
- `TripModel` represents a trip with destinations, dates, etc.
- CRUD operations are handled through the provider

### Weather Service
- `WeatherService` communicates with the Weather API
- Data is cached for offline use
- Weather forecasts are displayed per location

### Maps Integration
- `MapService` abstracts map functionality
- Google Maps used for web
- Native map implementations for mobile
- Supports offline maps through MapBox

### UI Components
- Material Design based components
- Custom theming for consistent look and feel
- Responsive design for different screen sizes

## Data Flow

1. User actions trigger events in the UI
2. Events are handled by providers
3. Providers call services/repositories
4. Services fetch/update data
5. Providers update state
6. UI rebuilds with new state

## State Management

The app uses a hierarchical state management approach:
- App-level state: theme, authentication, etc.
- Feature-level state: current trip, selected destination, etc.
- Component-level state: form input, animations, etc.

## API Integration

### Weather API
- Uses HTTPS for secure communication
- API key stored securely
- Rate limiting handled with retry logic

### Google Maps API
- JavaScript API used for web platform
- Native SDKs for mobile platforms
- Custom styling applied for consistent look

### Offline Support
- Local database using SQLite/Hive
- Cached images and map data
- Sync mechanism for reconnection

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- Services and business logic
- Data transformations
- Utility functions

### Widget Tests
- UI components
- Screen layouts
- Navigation

### Integration Tests
- End-to-end workflows
- API integration
- Cache mechanisms

## Performance Considerations

- Lazy loading of images
- Efficient list rendering with ListView.builder
- Memory management for large datasets
- Background processing for intensive tasks

## Security

- API keys stored securely
- Network traffic over HTTPS
- Input validation
- No sensitive data stored in plain text

## Known Issues and Workarounds

1. Weather API icon URLs sometimes missing HTTPS
   - Solution: URL correction in the `WeatherService`

2. URL Launcher compatibility issues
   - Solution: Platform-specific implementations

3. Google Maps rendering on web
   - Solution: Custom JavaScript bridge

## Future Technical Improvements

1. Migrate to Riverpod for more flexible dependency injection
2. Implement more comprehensive error handling
3. Add analytics and crash reporting
4. Enhance accessibility features
5. Optimize for different device capabilities

## Development Workflow

1. Work on feature branches
2. Run tests locally before pushing
3. Use Pull Requests for code review
4. CI/CD pipeline for automated testing
5. Staged releases (alpha, beta, production)

## Common Development Tasks

### Adding a New Feature

1. Create a new folder in `features/` for the feature
2. Define models in `models/`
3. Implement services in `services/`
4. Create providers in `providers/`
5. Build UI components in the feature folder
6. Add tests for all components

### Debugging Tips

1. Use `flutter run --verbose` for detailed logs
2. Enable network inspection in DevTools
3. Use the Provider debugger for state tracking
4. Check platform-specific logs for native issues

### Building for Production

```bash
# Android
flutter build apk --release
flutter build appbundle --release

# iOS
flutter build ios --release

# Web
flutter build web --release
```

## Versioning Strategy

- Semantic versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH)
- Release notes for each version
- Git tags for version tracking
